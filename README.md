# Thrift-Books
 A platform for buying and selling used books.

   
 Pug, CSS, Javascript for the front-end, Node.js, Express.js for the back-end and MongoDB as the database.
 
 With this project, our purpose was to provide users access to used books at low prices and to provide them a platform to sell their used books that are no longer needed. The website has been developed as an   
 Express application. We made use of PUG template engine to use inline JavaScript and render dynamic content. In order to make the website secure, the passwords have been hashed using bcrypt. The users just need to 
 sign in by providing their general information and can get access to all of the features of the web application. Thrift books Website will not only help readers to get best deals but it is also environment 
 friendly as weâ€™re reducing paper usage by not printing new books.
 
 Integrated a customer-to-customer chat feature using Socket.io, enabling buyers and sellers to negotiate, request more information about items, and more.
 
 Integrated PhonePe Payment API for seamless payment processing.
